## Presented at SABR Analytics Conference March 2021

The code and data that I used to create my presentation *Modeling Plate Discipline from the KBO to MLB*, which was presented at the SABR Analytics Conference in March 2021, can be found here.

The KBO data contained in this project was manually charted myself and the work and opinions contained in this paper and presentation are my own and not representative of anyone else. You can view the data on the [KBO Wizard](https://benhowell71.shinyapps.io/KBO_Wizard/).

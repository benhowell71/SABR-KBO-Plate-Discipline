# Modeling Plate Discipline from the KBO to MLB
## Presented at SABR Analytics Conference March 2021

The code and data that I used to create my presentation *Modeling Plate Discipline from the KBO to MLB*, which was presented at the SABR Analytics Conference in March 2021, can be found here.

The KBO data contained in this project was manually charted myself and the work and opinions contained in this paper and presentation are my own and not representative of anyone else. You can view the data on the [KBO Wizard](https://benhowell71.shinyapps.io/KBO_Wizard/).

There are a lot of files that ended up being used to knit the final paper, partially because I couldn't remember which pieces of data I had previously loaded in. However, if you download the entirety of the data here, this project is reproducible.

The most interesting files and pieces of data are the files located in the *Charted KBO Data* file, which contains the 29,784 pitches that I manually tracked from the 2020 KBO season and have now made publicly available.
